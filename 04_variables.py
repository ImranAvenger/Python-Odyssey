# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
# Variables in Python:
x =5
y= "Hello, world!"
# Always rememeber to add this "":(
print(x)
print(y)
x = 5
y = 'John'
print(x)
print(y)
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
 
print(x,y,z)
